# algoTrader

This was an implementation of an algorithmic day trading bot that aims to index as many stocks as possible simultaneously and create the "perfect portfolio" as defined by optimising the sharpe ratio. 

The script takes live stock data and uses a correlation matrix to determine a balances portfolio and then runs a sharpe ratio calculation against each portfolio to find the theoretical best one. 

I wanted to learn more about algorithmic trading so I ended up writing my own implementations of sharpe ratio calculations and portfolio stock allocations / balancing. Let me know if you have any feedback!
